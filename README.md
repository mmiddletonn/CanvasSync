# CanvasSync

## IMPORTANT

I have only gotten this working in chrome, firefox will merely show you the animation

## Demo

## Website

## How It Works

The website uses JavaScript to create an interactive canvas that dynamically adjusts its size and position based on screen and window dimensions. It continuously renders a visually dynamic orb, resulting in an engaging and animated web page element.
